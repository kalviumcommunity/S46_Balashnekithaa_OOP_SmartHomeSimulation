# Smart Home Simulation

## Project Description

The Smart Home Simulation is a C++ project designed to simulate the functioning of a modern smart home. It models various components like smart lights, thermostats, and security systems, allowing users to control and monitor their home environment through code interactions.

## Features

- **Smart Lighting System**: Adjust brightness and set lighting schedules.
- **Thermostat Control**: Set and monitor home temperature settings.
- **Security System**: Simulate locking/unlocking doors and monitor security status.

## Programming Language

This project is implemented using C++ to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts.

## OOP Concepts

The project makes use of the following OOP concepts:
- **Classes and Objects**: Defines separate classes for each smart home component.
- **Encapsulation**: Uses private attributes and public methods to control access.
- **`this` Pointer**: Used in methods to reference the invoking object's attributes and methods.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to see the simulation in action.
